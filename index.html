              “Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and
              I'm not sure about the universe.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “There are only two ways to live your life. One is as though
              nothing is a miracle. The other is as though everything is a
              miracle.”
            </p>
            <p>
              “I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination.
              Imagination is more important than knowledge. Knowledge is
              limited. Imagination encircles the world.”
            </p>

            <p>
              “If you want to find the secrets of the universe, think in terms

            <p>
              “I don't care that they stole my idea . . I care that they don't

            </p>
            <p>
              “Be alone, that is the secret of invention; be alone, that is when

              “I do not know what I may appear to the world, but to myself I
              seem to have been only like a boy playing on the sea-shore, and
              diverting myself in now and then finding a smoother pebble or a
              prettier shell than ordinary, whilst the great ocean of truth lay
              all undiscovered before me.”
